# BridgeTower: Investigating Multi-Modal Transformers and Their Predictive Capabilities on Human Brain Activity

## Overview

Welcome to the BridgeTower project! This repository is dedicated to investigating the multi-modal transformer, BridgeTower, and its predictive capabilities compared to the human brain. As a collaborative effort between cognitive psychology and data science, this project aims to explore the potential of neural networks in capturing and predicting mechanisms of the human brain.

## Motivation

### Cognitive Psychology meets Data Science

As a cognitive psychologist and data scientist, I am deeply intrigued by the prospect of leveraging neural networks to comprehend and predict cognitive processes. The foundation for this exploration is inspired by the groundbreaking work conducted by the Huth Lab at UT Austin, as presented in their paper [**link to paper**]. In their study, Huth and colleagues demonstrated the remarkable ability of visual and language encoding models to predict fMRI responses to diverse stimuli, highlighting the cross-modality transferability of neural representations within the human brain.

## Replication and Expansion

### Building on Huth Lab's Work

This project begins by replicating the Huth Lab's recent findings, serving as a solid foundation for further investigations. The successful cross-modality transfer showcased in their work sets the stage for an extensive exploration into the capabilities of neural networks in understanding human cognition.

## Key Objectives

- **Replication:** Reimplementing the experiments conducted by the Huth Lab to verify the robustness of their findings.
- **Extension:** Expanding upon the replicated work to delve deeper into the neural representations and their predictive power.
- **Innovation:** Introducing novel approaches and methodologies to push the boundaries of what is currently understood about the relationship between neural networks and human cognitive processes.

## Project Structure

- **Data:** Contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **Models:** Houses the implementation of BridgeTower and other relevant models.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of replication and subsequent investigations.
- **Results:** Stores the results of experiments, visualizations, and analysis outputs.
- **Scripts:** Supplementary scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
