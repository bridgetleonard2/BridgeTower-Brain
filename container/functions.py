    This assumes that the samples are ordered in time.
    Adding a delay of 0 corresponds to leaving the features unchanged.
    Adding a delay of 1 corresponds to using features from the previous sample.

    Adding multiple delays can be used to take into account the slow
    hemodynamic response, with for example `delays=[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delays : array-like or None
        Indices of the delays applied to each feature. If multiple values are
        given, each feature is duplicated for each delay.

    Attributes
    ----------

        Number of features seen during the fit.

    -------
